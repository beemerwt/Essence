# Essence

**Essence** is a lightweight, modern Essentials-style mod for Fabric servers.  
It provides all the quality-of-life utilities you expect — homes, warps, TPA, spawn, jails, and more — built for performance, stability, and modded compatibility.

---

## 🪶 Overview

Essence is designed to be the spiritual successor to the classic *EssentialsX* plugin, rebuilt from the ground up for Fabric.  
It focuses on simplicity, persistence, and integration with modern systems like the Fabric Permissions API and SQLite storage.

- Fully server-side — no client mod required.  
- Safe, transactional SQLite database for player and location data.  
- Integrated permission handling with automatic fallback to vanilla op levels.  
- Command-based player utilities that work even for offline players.

## ✨ Features

- **Homes & Warps** – Easily set, delete, and teleport to named locations.
- **Spawn Command** – Return to the world spawn or teleport new players automatically.
- **TPA System** – Request, accept, and deny teleportations between players.
- **Jails** – Temporarily or permanently restrict player movement.
- **Mute & Ban Commands** – Optional administrative tools for moderation.
- **Offline Player Support** – Manage data for players who are not currently online.
- **SQLite Persistence** – Player and location data stored in WAL-enabled SQLite databases under `config/Essence/`.
- **Permissions Integration** – Supports LuckPerms or any mod implementing Fabric Permissions API.
